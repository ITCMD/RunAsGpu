# RunAsGPU
Allows you to run programs on your secondary GPU [inspired by Kernel Kue on the LTT forums](https://linustechtips.com/main/topic/940423-setting-2nd-gpu-as-power-saving-in-graphics-settings-on-windows-10/).

AMD Support is experimental, please report any bugs!

## To Use:
1. Download runasgpu.bat and devcon.exe
2. Run it
3. Select your Primary GPU (only has to be done once. To change, delete card.ini)
4. Choose a program to launch on your secondary GPU
5. It will prompt for admin access and launch it!

### WARNING: Your screen WILL go black twice when launching the program.
### WARNING: Do not use this while a game is running!
